A lazy rain am I, the skies refuse to cry
Cremation takes its piece of your supply
The night is dressed like noon, a sailor spoke too soon
And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hit me now)

Platypus are a few, the secret life of Roo
A personality I never knew (Get it on)
My Greta weighs a ton, the archers on the run
And no one stands alone behind the sun

It's been a long time since I made a new friend

Waitin' on another black summer to end,
It's been a long timå and you never know when
